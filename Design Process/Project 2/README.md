# Analog To Digital Converter

A circuit that will take an analog reading of an input voltage and convert that into a digital representation within a 2% accuracy range.

We were required to use the Arduino to develop a circuit that can take an analog reading of voltage and convert it into a digital output. The input voltage can have a range from 0 to 10 volts, so the circuit must be able to have that input variability range. Our constraints were essentially the limitations of using the equipment on hand as it can potentially limit how we choose to design our circuit.
